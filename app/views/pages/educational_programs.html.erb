          <h3>1. Meeting the Educational Needs</h3>
          <p>Students of the Reason to Give program begin by creating a personal development plan. Working one-on-one with a coach, each student determines their own strengths and weakness, identifies obstacles, and sets long and short term goals using SMART criteria. Each student then completes a short video about who they are, where they want to be, and how they can get there. This gives the students a sense of ownership of their future and makes them accountable to the outside world.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The First Term</h3>
          <p>Reason to Give’s intensive education program provides students with the tools to be both successful at home and in their professional lives. While our ultimate goal is to have our graduates achieve self sufficiency, we believe that without a stable home environment, success in the outside world is far less likely.</p>

          <h3>The Third Term</h3>
          <p>The final part of our program allows students to explore different avenues through which they can achieve their long-term goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding reliable employment</li>
            <li>Job training programs</li>
            <li>Options in higher education</li>

          <h3>Our Classes</h3>
          <p>Classes are facilitated by our community partners, experts in their respective fields from local schools, organizations, and businesses. Facilitators provide follow-up resources and contact information. By the end of the program, students have a much larger network of people in the community they can reach out to and a binder packed full of help on everything covered in the program.</p>

      <h3>2. Meeting The Material Needs</h3>
      <p>While we feel education is fundamental to self sufficiency, Reason to Give is aware that having certain immediate needs met is imperative to students achieving their goals. Reason to Give works with students to help them identify their material needs. These may be bus or gas cards to get to work, office appropriate attire, educational fees, or funds to start a home business.</p>
      <p>We believe that having a reliable computer and access to information is crucial to success in today’s world. Upon completing the Reason to Give program, all graduates are awarded a laptop computer. Through reasontogive.com, do gooders can donate directly to help students receive the educational and material needs necessary to meet their goals.</p>

            <h3>3. Ensuring Success</h3>
            <p>Before being accepted into the Reason to Give program, students must commit to one year of work with our organization. Each student must complete five months of educational classes, attend monthly progress meetings, volunteer at one of our community events, and mentor a new student during the next five month program.</p>
            <p>During the Reason to Give program, students are required to stay on track with their personal development plan. Regular progress meetings with their coaches and mentors help students to follow the guidelines laid out in their SMART goals. Coaches then provide students with additional resources and assistance as necessary.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>The End Goal</h3>
            <p>At the end of the five month program, graduates are asked to mentor a student during the next five month term. They are required to attend monthly progress meetings with a coach and their mentee. </p> 
            <p>Reason to Give will continue to support students after graduation to help them achieve their long term goals. We will provide resources, help with applications and resumes, and connect graduates with our partners for further education, training, and employment.</p>
            <p>*Reason to Give provides free educational childcare for all of our students to ensure that everyone can participate in our program.</p>
